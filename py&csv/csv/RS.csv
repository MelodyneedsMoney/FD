 University students have their heads shaved at the Japanese Embassy in Korea in protest at the decision to release treated water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant.,,,,
"They are, you know.The great Kim Jong Un welcome team.",,,,
Does the Japanese media properly report who they are?,,,,
" Their claims of ""contaminated water"" are not true and are completely wrong.",,,,
"And they are so rude and malicious that they ""don't trust"" the information officially released by Japan because of their assumptions.",,,,
 If it is so safe Japanese citizens should eat it.  Don't dump them in the sea the common property of mankind.,,,,
 Japan is disposing treated water. There are no radioactive materials except for tritium which will be disposed of over the course of several decades starting in around two years.,,,,
It should also be noted even if the full amount of tritium contained within the tanks was released in a single year the impact would be no more than 1/1000th of the exposure impact of natural radiation in one year in Japan.,,,,
 Korean are great!,,,,
 What happened? Don't understand the problem. Japanese release nuclear waste into South Korean's sea?,,,,
 Oh guys I thought these mfs were shaving their head for some bs reasons but actually it‚Äôs for children who got cancer off of the radiation and stuff,,,,
 the Tokyo Summer Games should be cancelled. PERIOD.,,,,

 Fair fucks to them,,,,
 Japan has often made decisions that will effect Koreans with no regards to them and no remorse,,,,
 Reading this gave me a stroke. First of all wtf why are they dumping it into the sea?? and second shaving their heads??? and it's students? Isn't this more sanctions territory? like shouldn't the US or South Korea bein goin to the UN over it to stop them?,,,,
Did they protest 5 years ago in the same way?,,,,
"...in 2016, the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant in South Korea released the equivalent of roughly 143 trillion becquerels, the liquid portion of which was released into the Sea of Japan.",,,,
  Both the United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency have reacted positively to Japan's plan for tritium release. China and South Korea meanwhile seem to conveniently forget that their,,,,
 Korea is releasing more contaminated water into the ocean than Japan,,,,
 This is another instance of people not understanding science. The water itself is not nuclear (you can't make non-nuclear elements nuclear) - it had nuclear elements in it which they are removing. There will be traces of tritium - which is a naturally occurring element anyway.,,,,
 Lmfao Koreans stay mad,,,,
 This is ridiculousÔºåwhy the all world should pay for the issue of Japan we can do only thing that ban Japan to release the nuclear water to ocean.,,,,
 I'm against nuclear power plants but Koreans don't seem to know that Korean nuclear power plants are doing the same thing.,,,,
"I think it's better to know more about your own country than about other countries.""",,,,
 Why isn't this world news? This is dangerous on so many levels,,,,
 The water's been treated. There is less radiation per liter in the Fukushima water than there is in the ocean. It's not even remotely dangerous.,,,,
 Less it forget the comfort stations and their monstrous experiments,,,,

 Decades old crimes by a different government by a different generation who are almost all in their graves thet have long since been tried and paid for.,,,,
 If it‚Äôs treated I see no problem but the Japanese should take caution with the water before releasing it and ensure it‚Äôs radiation free.,,,,
 If it‚Äôs so safe why are they dumping it? Why not use it in agriculture or reprocess it for drinking water?,,,,
 People getting outraged about this clearly don't understand anything about nuclear power. The water is contaminated in the same way my urine is it really isn't a big deal. The water won't have any effects on wildlife it was irradiated not mixed with toxic coal dust.,,,,
 Probably no confidence that they are being honest about treating it ...cannot blame them. Most company/governments would not be honest about not taking all precautions after all. (copied),,,,
people saying this is scary have 0 IQ if you actually think that Japanese government is that dumb to fuck themselves over like that knowing it would mostly affect them and would affect them first. like really? get me out,,,,
 Try treatments first. You want salt water? Add some salt and see if it cleans it.,,,,

 People who are genuinely worried about this have no idea how insanely little radioactive material would be present in the water after its treatment. To quote Kyle Hill,,,,
