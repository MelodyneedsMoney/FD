,,,
 You're challenging the human line,,,
 Perhaps u should stand in front of the camera and drink a glass of ‘pure water’ resulted by handling the waste water with Suga Yoshihide? Then u can show ur appreciation to the efforts contributed by the Japanese government.,,,
 That water should send to USA as drinking water since Japan saids that water is drinkable!!!!,,,
 I do think you need a glass of the waste water because it seems to be better than bottled water by Japanese government standards.,,,
 Really? This pollution eventually will hit everyone in some aspect. Everything is connected. So thank to this to kill everyone eventually ?,,,
 I told my parents don't use plastics to protect our ocean. Japan told the world they gonna dump nuclear water into the sea,,,
 Yes let's move in for a group hug. Hooray for death to marine life!! The constant oil spills and trash dumping none of it is enough - let's nuke the fkg ocean inhabitants and eco system now and let's NOT be ashamed over fishing,,,
 Bless you drink the holy water from Japan,,,
 shame of you,,,
 SB,,,
 This must be a new definition of 'transparent'. Heard it's safe for drinking right? Then please arrange it to be sent to the US and keep it all to yourselves.,,,
" I wil thank you if you decide dump part of the ""clean"" water into your swimming pool.",,,
 unless thank now means fuck... in that case I thank you very much too.,,,
 Disaster to Pacific and California.,,,
 No thanks when your generation suffering from the coming disaster,,,
"Japan decided to discharge nuclear waste water into the sea! However, the US Secretary of State tweeted: Thank you for the transparent efforts.... ",,,
Netizens criticized: Are you serious? Don’t you know that sewage pollutes the ocean? What will he say if China does it?,,,
日方明显努力这点真是让人发笑，当年不接受俄罗斯专家的方案，现在还往大海排污染物。,,,
"It raised high risk to humanity, JP government is highly irresponsible!",,,
BLINKEN is more brave than i thought in protecting his so called allies. so crazy that they want to kill the planet together,,,
"You know If China does it, Mr Secretary will call us as the biggest world destroyer, animal killer and rogue country of the earth.",,,
China will never do this kind of things. This is not right to compare China and Japan.,,,
日本一边正式跟美国签订友好文件一边偷袭珍珠港，如果真无害为什么要放在密封罐子里储存十年？是否真能做到只含有“氚”值得怀疑，日本是否邀请相关国家共同审核处理结果？是否邀请第三方机构评估？原子能机构只是在日本宣布之后表示会提供技术支持，不要一味地为他国洗地，这不会显得你道德高尚鹤立鸡群,,,
"It wont be radioactive when it's sent back to sea, what's the issue? If you can clean land off radioactivity you can clear water and thats what they are doing, maybe help them?",,,
"why they keep the ""clean water"" in canister ten years if the water really clean",,,
"If the United States really acquiesces in Japan's release of nuclear contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean, I believe that will be the beginning of the destruction of Japan as a country, the United States will also be punished by God, and the American people will also suffer",,,
This is why US thank Japanese. US now is not the only one pollute the ocean. Great.,,,
"I suppose he will say “ China deprive people’s right, the clean water is essential for every creature, so let’s Attack China, say No to China”",,,
You must call an emergency meeting at the UN!!!!!! NOW!!!!,,,
This is criminal.,,,
"This Blinken dude is Satan in disguise. A human disgrace! With these lunatics running America, the doomsday is not far fetched.",,,
"He will say China is uncivilised, selfish, couldn't give a damn for the world.",,,
美国可是老双标了,,,
"Fine,the nuclear water will first reach the west coast of the United States. In a sense, after 76 years, Japan finally completed its revenge on the United States and the world with nuclear technology",,,
Excellent response  Mr. Secretary.,,,
As an experienced diplomat you know you can trust the word of the Japanese Govt regarding the decontamination of the water to be disposed of.,,,
"You and Pompeo differ in weights, same all the rest.",,,
This is so ridiculous!,,,
There goes the West Coast and Alaskan fisheries!,,,
Everyone here is so pissed off after hearing the news. But it's the same process every other country routinely used to discharge treated water into the ocean even with tritium.,,,
Any moral high ground you thought you had regarding the environment was just destroyed by a single tweet. Wow.,,,
"Hahaha, it seems like they finally have a chance to destroy the world to finish what they want but couldn't im WW2. You nuked them before, now they nuke you back.",,,
What else are you going to say? Contamination is inevitable. There's a better way than nuclear power.,,,
"Mr. Secretary, Thank you so much. I firmly support the policy of the Government of Japan.",,,
"Dilution is not filtration, and the nuclear water remains radioactive, with the same amount of emissions. Don't forget the ocean currents, in two years US waters will also be affected by Japan's nuclear waste water.",,,
"I advise the Japanese to drink it if it's so clean and safe to drink, they can drink it, wash toilet with it, spray their garden with it or bottle and brand it 《Fukushima Nuclear Diluted Rare Earth Mineral Water》 that way they can make money out of it instead of dispose.",,,
"Seventy years ago, Japan unwisely invaded other Asian countries, and now it's going to pollute the sea with nuclear sewage, which makes trouble for East Asia again.",,,
It's GREAT misfortune to be a neighbor to such a country.,,,
Sounds like you are not looking out for the environment or the people. The dangers of the release of the water need to be addressed by an administration that touts science. There should be a news conference. ,,,
I was deeply impressed with your words.,,,
"As a Japanese, I would like to thank the benevolent words that are close to Fukushima.",,,
Haha. Sarcastic? US could take all the water.  No one is competing for it.,,,
Tritium is unable to be filtered and has a short half life of 12.5 years. It will go away.,,,
"That's what we did. Of course, we will agree that our son will do the same",,,
What a blessing to have competent leaders in our government who know what they are doing.,,,
Treated water?! Testify it. Suggest you drink 10L first.,,,
"Just because Japan is planning to poison the Pacific “transparently” does not make it acceptable. The US should be trying to protect our shared ocean, not cheering on its contamination.",,,
"With such a warm greeting from US top diplomat, the Japanese government may decide to instead send the water as a gift to the White House and Foggy Bottom.  It’s IQ Boost water.",,,
"I think many people have misunderstood. The treated water containing tritium is always released into the ocean from nuclear power plants all over the world. Of course, in the U.S., China, Korea as well. The IAEA says this is the normal way many countries have done.",,,
Why not evaporate it and use air scrubbers to filter the vapor from any radioactive particles? Or freeze it in giant floating solar powered steel ice cubes to cool the waters of the north/south pole and slow the melting of the ice caps. Need an engineer?,,,
They should build a pipeline directly to your house.,,,
Unbelievable! Why are we supporting this irresponsible action?,,,
This is not transparent at all. I don't understand why US government support this dangerous decision. As a S.Korean very disappointed which will bring disaster not only to Korea's Coasts but also to the Pacific region including Japan's Coasts. Even 70% Japanese are opposed to.,,,
I do not agree with this decision! What are the environmental impacts? The oceans are not a dumping ground for any garbage!!!!,,,
"Would you be as calm in your response to this impending global disaster if it were being perpetuated by China or Iran? Probably not, but I’m sure there is a reason the US isn’t calling this out as an act of environmental terrorism...",,,
Soviet Union: Used a lot of sacrifices to prevent the spread of Chernobyl radiation and saved half of Europe.,,,
 Japan: Discharging wastewater into the sea，let whole world“enjoy”it,,,
"Are they crazy? If the radioactive water is so clean, why not just pour it into a big hole and make it a lake or into one of their volcanos? They should keep it. Japan, the world isn't your sewer.",,,
