What gonna happen to animal in ocean,,
Say goodbye to the US West coast and half of the planet's sea life.. ,,
The Japanese 50 Years Later: The previous generation did this. Why blame us,,
The Japanese 50 Years Later: The previous generation did this. Why blame us,,
I’m sorry. It seems others who share the ocean should also get a voice.,,
"Yet more pollution being pumped in the oceans, yet more wildlife and fish being killed off, so much for every country cutting down on pollution and becoming more environmental friendly!!!!",,
"Why isn’t this huge detrimental action not a vote.  This effects everyone, wildlife & habitats worldwide.  Wtf Face with symbols over mouth",,
"It's not just wastewater, it's radioactive water from nuclear reactor!",,
That’s not how nuclear works. Even a normal shutdown takes a decade. This is not. Kemal. The best guess is that this will take 40 years to clean up. Every day they use more water to cool the broken reactor and produce more radioactive water.,,
Yes a week later I can imagine. Who’s smart arse idea was that?,,
I think the radiation is starting to damage their brains,,
And US supported it,,
"How can we, the collective we across all other nations, change this? This is beyond politics ... it's a decision being taken that could have rapid and wide spread affect on all our 'home' seas",,
They have just signed the oceans death warrant by doing this.,,
Yikes like someone said this is environmental terrorism,,
Why  the United States support Japan approves releasing wastewater into ocean ?,,
"Does the United States think that the sea will not move, or does it think that the east of the United States is not the Pacific Ocean?",,
How did they criticize Chernobyl back then?,,
This is shocking. Sanctions must be made against Japan. World leaders need to act rather than sleepwalk into disaster,,
Who gave them the fucking right to do this ? The United States should have finished what it started at the end of world war II. Remember all is fair in love and war.,,
"Living things are doing pretty well in Chernobyl, nature has been flourishing since the human predator left the area...",,
We are surrounded by natural radiation anyway often at higher levels than proposed here. Only those who don’t understand the science are concerned. Fortunately the knee jerk reactions of a few are not relevant.,,
How much ocean lives will be destroyed？！,,
So many nuclear physicists on here. Very impressed,,
This is why nuclear power isn't a viable option. Humans are too dumb.,,
"Thank You BBC for the explanation with right words unlike China using harsh and provocative English intentionally attacking Japanese gov’t and fishermen.

It’s contradictory Korea releases more contaminated and nuclear condense water into ocean and criticizes Japan.",,
This need sorted NOW... don't be so bloody filthy. I can't get over this.. Total prats.,,
Oh no mutation sushi is coming,,
That wastewater is cleaner than wastewater from nuclear palnt in you country. That is the fact. ahaha.,,
Why do you report so late? The world should stop Japan and address the Tokyo Olympics,,
What's the alternative...take water into Sahara desert and let it evaporate off similar to boil water in a large vat till it evaporates off....,,
American government agreed！Fuck!,,
Are they seriously so stupid as to poison the oceans that provide their fish and whales??,,
"Japan is a selfish, garbage country that allows all mankind and all marine life to pay for their nuclear waste. American support and the West have no sound, snake and mouse a nest, double standard to the extreme. These inferior nationalities and countries quickly die out!",,
"I wish someone can stand up to Japan, first they kill dolphins , now they will kill everyone.",,
This video shows that how the Japan’s wastewater will pollute the whole ocean. Please let more people know this and boycott this decision of the Japanese government!!!!!!!!PLEASE!,,
Nuclear power is dangerous what your are left with doesn't go away after 24hrs more like thousands of years. When Nuclear goes wrong just look at Chernobyl and a few more. It's easy to think of today and be selfish but what if today means tomorrow isn't here,,
"This should be a decision made by the whole world, not Japan, as it is OUR OCEAN they will be polluting FOREVER.",,
Japan couldn't give a toss about the planet. This should be stopped and Japan hit with serious sanctions and fines. What a disgusting country.,,
"Ffs people, the water has been filtered and is safe to release. Do you all think there’s no radioactivity in nature? This is a drop in the bucket - literally, and will decay away to nothing in the vastness of the Pacific Ocean. Get a fucking grip.",,
And this is a country that eats raw fish all the time! Let’s sit and watch the new Covid arrive!,,
Stupid Japanese government and lawmakers should publicly drink a bottle of wastewater to show that it's not dangerous. What a stupid decision,,
So where is our beloved Greta Thunberg now?,,
"japanese should try harder,  dont give up,  dont kill the ocean and human beings",,
Wrong JAPAN!!!! Killing whales now polluting the oceans. Shame on you!!!,,
"Double standard western propaganda. If China does this, the western world will accuse them severly and event make sanctions to China. However, you don't blame Japan for doing this evil thing.",,
"What takes you so long to post this piece? How can you be sure it's ""harmless"" water? Have you got any evidence at all? As a world leading press, you are being so irresponsible and mis-leading.",,
"When u see every first comments of such news in Twitter is telling people it's safe and don't worry about it, u know how terrible it will be.",,
"Japan just want the world to have another more tragedies like the COVID-19！As world citizens share the one world, one planet, we should stop it and won’t let these happen!!!",,
This is wrong on so many levels the ocean does not belong to them for a start,,
As if the seas aren’t polluted enough!!!,,
Watch out for Blinky the three eyed fish then,,
 For all those gammons who mocked Greta, get ready for radio active caviar.,
 Lbastoss,,
 HUMANS ARE THE ONLY ANIMAL THAT SHIT WHERE THEY EAT.,,
 Graham Grice,,
 There you go all you nut jobs from Rebellion Extinction, piss off to Japan and sort this out. Dare you, go on.....
The 90’s,,
 Sounds nice,,
  Roger Won't Cooperate,,
 Didn't they learn from Godzilla?,,
 The Japanese can solve it by drinking two cups per person,,
Japan just want the world to have another more tragedies like the COVID-19！As world citizens share the one world, one planet, we should stop it and won’t let these happen!!!

  Help me people…My Father Is Suffering From Kidney Disease. We Need Your Help To Provide For His Treatment by Romit...,,
 Ha ha ha! The US government is applauding this decision! The despicable Japan has met the evil America! The sorrow of the people of the world!,,
