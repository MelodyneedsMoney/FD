Disgusting! Shocking! Ignorant!  There are no words to express the abuse to our oceans!,,,,,
Where are the CNN and BBC？,,,,,
Let's reject such a stupid decision. Sea is shared with Whole world. NOT BELONG TO JAPAN ONLY!,,,,,
Fk Japan Gov,,,,,
"This is simply anti-human behavior. Japan must immediately terminate such a plan, otherwise it will bring devastating disasters to the world.",,,,,
Boycott the Olympic Games in Japan!!!,,,,,
I read this earlier and was surprised that Japan would be so irresponsible.,,,,,
Unfortunately it is done now so let's hope our oceans can cope with another abuse.,,,,,
I can't believe the US is seemingly agreeing to this. The water currents would directly head for California. I personally won't eat seafood from now on esp. on the lookout for seafood from the Pacific ocean..,,,,,
"Not expected from a country like Japan, they have witnessed catastrophe of radioactivity since ages, if human suffered so much despite of having advances medical support...think about wild life living under the ocean.",,,,,
Highly inhuman behavior,,,,,
The people of Japan have a human right to have pollution free electricity. Nuclear power gives this.,,,,,
All these Greenpeace campaigns which ignore the science do not help.,,,,,
"just imagine if China doing this, how US and the world going to react. All dirty politic games but the disaster is real",,,,,
Hasn’t the water been cleaned so radiation levels are below that of drinking water?,,,,,
"Kudos to Greenpeace for speaking up.  If the Fukushima wasted water is treated well enough and even safer than drink water as claimed by some Japanese leaders, then they should just drink it in Japan or irrigate Japanese farmland.  Please don’t export to the rest of the world!!!",,,,,
Japan’s blatant disregard for and abuse of the environment is a crime,,,,,
Condemnable. The people living in Pacific should come out strongly against Japanese action.,,,,,
Shameless! Japan needs a better solution. I share the concerns of countries in the region. Keep the radioactive fish strictly on television.,,,,,
very sad news . steps to neutralise neuclear weapons and radiobactive wastes is necessary for the peaceful existence of life in earth,,,,,
"Japan has decided with the ""thank"" from @SecBlinken   to dump over 1.23 million tons of Fukushima radioactive waste water stored into the Pacific Ocean is purely disregarding the human rights and interests of the people of the Asia-Pacific region.",,,,,
"China established some water dams and nuclear power plants.
US: this is destroying the environment!
Japan will dump the extremely harmful nuclear water into the pacific sea.
US: oh that’s ok
What a double standard.",,,,,
Bulink thanks Japannese for their transparency.,,,,,
and surely the rights of all affected marine life too?,,,,,
Do something. We cannot let this happen.,,,,,
The most insane is that US support and welcome Japan to do so.,,,,,
 Is Japan gone crazy,,,,,
 they have put sea lives in danger. They have found Sea as a dustbin. Now this toxic radioactive water will spread all over the world.,,,,,
 Tell China  South Korea  United State etc. to stop doing the same thing then,, Taiwan, United State, Canada,
  一つの幸せ、美しい音,,,,,
 just tell your the truth. Why? Because they agree with Japanese release radiative waste water.,,,,,
 What's your action? Just a tweet? Does that help!!,,,,,
 Why is there no democratic vote? First among them are the Japanese people.,,,,,
 lol humans are terrible,,,,,
  The Ottomans committed Genocide,,,,,
 说得对，日本政府真的太无能了,,,,,
 Dionysus Silenus,,,,,
  Fucking American virus,,,,,
 Shit Japan,,,,,
 Greenpeace exists because this fragile Earth deserves a voice. It needs solutions. It needs change. It needs action.,,,,,
shocked！,,,,,
How can we stop it,,,,,
Omg. Violence against humanity. And Mother Earyh.,,,,,
i won't eat any seafood from Japan or Asia anymore,,,,,
what do you think about this？Don't be silence.,,,,,
"After water circulation, almost all water resources will be polluted by nuclear sewage…",,,,,
"Kudos to Greenpeace for speaking up.  If the Fukushima wasted water is treated well enough and even safer than drink water as claimed by some Japanese leaders, then they should just drink it in Japan or irrigate Japanese farmland.  Please don’t export to the rest of the world!!!",,,,,
Stop them now! All options!,,,,,
They would need to do the storage for the next 50 years after the rods are removed from the continuous leaking. The release of radiation will continue and so will the need to dump it..,,,,,
The tritium concentration in that water is about 20mg in the whole tons of water that will be then diluted in the infinite [in comparison] amount of water of the Ocean.,,,,,
"This is an absolutely safe amount of tritium, is indeed way lower than the amount already in those water.",,,,,
Why not pack tritiated water (radioactive contaminated water) from the Fukushima nuclear power plant in a PET bottle and sell it? Build a production plant in Fukushima and hire people who have lost the opportunity to work.(1/5),,,,,
"And it's going to hit the Shores of WA and OR states soon, the same as 10 years ago.",,,,,
The world! The works depends on the Pacific Ocean.,,,,,
"I strongly disagree with this. I also want to know how other countries dispose the nuclear waste - for example the UK, I found the gov’s website and it basically says they keep it on lands about 100 years until it becomes safe to dispose.",,,,,
Finally we can see the real godzilla,,,,,
how ironic，Japan make godzilla,,,,,
Bamboo chopsticks are more important than radiation ??!! Holy shit,,,,,
"Oh fuck, this is how they got Godzilla in the movies.",,,,,
Those who say it is safe because it used the same ALPS process as other nuclear power plants are based on the poor assumption that TEPCO will abide by the rule. They as well as the gov have been rather trying to hide the issues and silencing every question than being transparent!,,,,,
Extremely shocking! This makes me feel sick to my stomach.,,,,,
"1.23 million tons of water sounds like a lot of water, and it is. The Pacific Ocean contains about 700 billion tons of water, or about 560,000 times more.",,,,,
How much will the Fukushima water affect radiation levels in waters surrounding Japan and across the Pacific Ocean?,,,,,
A weapon of mass destruction that is being overlooked since they're allies of the great USA.,,,,,
"Are they crazy? If the radioactive water is so clean, why not just pour it into a big hole and make it a lake or into one of their volcanos? They should keep it. Japan, the world isn't your sewer.",,,,,
I'm old enough to remember scientist saying nuclear power was absolute safe. Only 1 in a billion chance that something bad happens. There have been 99 accidents at nuclear power plants from 1952 to 2009.,,,,,
Please let Japs drink more fukushima water then you will not need to release them to the sea,,,,,
this is how a country with votes works,,,,,
