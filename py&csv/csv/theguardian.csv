 Other countries must band together and tell Japan that this is NOT allowed! Between adding toxic water to the sea and whaling Japan is becoming as anti-environment as China! It has to stop!,
 This is the wrong decision to make ever and this will contaminate the sea water and also cause extream danger to humans and also sea life but the planet too! The contaminated water should be disposed safely to stop further damage and prevent consequences....,
 And,
 has the cheek to criticise &amp; preach to the Uk! Get out to Japan love &amp; the other countries doing irreparable damage!,
  HOLLEYWOOD,
 What did I missed why the fuck is this okay? Tell them they can't do that do they think the sea is just endless it dumps into the ocean you're going to kill and contaminate the water and fish how f****** stupid is this why do we allow this to happen did I miss something?,
  sharad bharat,
Thank you sir,
Respected editor , please mention after treating the contamination they will discharge it in the ocean. 
  deborahh,
  marie #Extinction Is Forever,
 Nooooooooooooo,
 you already contaminated the entire ocean and ocean life,
  Stand with Myanmar,
 Japan kills the ocean.,
  Distribution of the radioactive contamination in the Pacific Ocean...,
  The data of the modeling of Distribution of the radioactive contamination in the Pacific Ocean from Fukushima by the GEOMAR | Helmholtz-Zentrum für Ozeanfors...,
Every *second* the Sun pours 2700 Hiroshima bombs of energy on Earth,
interacting with nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere,producing annually ~410 grams of natural Tritium.
Japan is 4th on the list of countries who relies on fish from the sea. Does this make sense?,
 They … are mad,
 Soviet Union: Used a lot of sacrifices to prevent the spread of Chernobyl radiation and saved half of Europe.,
 Japan: Discharging wastewater into the sea，let whole world“enjoy”it,
Radiation levels are very different though - the stuff being discharged in Japan in much less dangerous and will decay to nothing ~1000x faster.,
 So is it a good news? Wao great! I think there is no Environmentalist there to ask about it.,
 Where are all international climate or Environmental activists like,
 . Please someone mention other activists here so I also can knows about them. Are they alive or not?,
 Uh oh..,
