    <h2 id="about">Fukushima Discrepancy</h2>
<p class="p1">
    <span style="font-family: It;"> Fukushima Discrepancy  </span>is a project about the dynamic relationship amongst the media news, the public discussion,
    and the event of Japan Fukushima treated water. <br>
    It also aims at exploring the potential possibility of endangering marine life by political-related public opinion.<br>
    An absurd and playful way of presentation is designed to display how this trending environment topic is changing in the public.<br>

    The original data is scraped from the replies under different news on Twitter.<br><br>
    Through sentimental analysis of each set of replies, the processed data is gathered.<br>
    The visualization of data is applied in generative sketches.<br>
    The process of the mutation of the hand-drawn style marine creatures can be seen when the mouse moves to the animations, which include underlying meanings related to the nuclear-treated water event.<br>
    There is a gallery collecting all the mutant creatures, which links to the original Twitter news pages.<br>
